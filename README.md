cython-lint
===========

Everything ``flake8`` used to do (by accident), plus much more.

A tool and pre-commit hook to lint Cython files.

## Installation

```console
$ pip install cython-lint
```

## Usage as a pre-commit hook

See [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) for instructions

Sample `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
-   repo: https://github.com/MarcoGorelli/cython-lint
    rev: v0.16.0
    hooks:
    -   id: cython-lint
    -   id: double-quote-cython-strings
```

## Command-line example

```console
$ cython-lint my_file_1.pyx my_file_2.pyx
my_file_1.pyx:54:5: 'get_conversion_factor' imported but unused
my_file_2.pyx:1112:38: 'mod' defined but unused (try prefixing with underscore?)
my_file_3.pyx:4:9: dangerous default value!
my_file_3.pyx:5:9: comma after base type in definition
```

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available:
- exclude lines by including a ``# no-cython-lint`` comment (analogous to ``# noqa`` in ``flake8``);

as well as the following command-line arguments:
- ``--max-line-length`` to control the maximum line length used by pycodestyle;
- ``--no-pycodestyle`` if you don't want the pycodestyle checks;
- ``--ignore`` if you want to ignore some specific pycodestyle checks;
- ``--files`` to pass a Regex pattern with which to match files to include;
- ``--exclude`` to pass a Regex pattern with which to match files to exclude.

Configuration can be set project-wise in a `pyproject.toml` file at the root of the project.
Here's an example `pyproject.toml`:
```
[tool.cython-lint]
max-line-length = 88
ignore = ['E503', 'E504']
exclude = 'my_project/excluded_cython_file.pyx'
```

## Which checks are implemented?

- assert statement with tuple condition (always true...)
- comma after base type definition (e.g. ``cdef ndarray, arr``)
- comparison between constants
- dangerous default value
- dict key repeated
- dict key variable repeated
- f-string without placeholders
- if-statement with tuple condition (always true...)
- late-binding closures https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#late-binding-closures
- pointless string statement
- ``pycodestyle`` nitpicks (which you can turn off with ``--no-pycodestyle``)
- repeated element in set
- ``.strip``, ``.rstrip``, or ``.lstrip`` used with repeated characters
- unnecessary list index lookup
- unnecessary import alias
- variable defined but unused
- variable imported but unused

In addition, the following automated fixers are implemented:

- double-quote-cython-strings (replace single quotes with double quotes, like the ``black`` formatter does)

More to come! Requests welcome!
